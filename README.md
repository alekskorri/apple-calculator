🏆 Why I Built This

This calculator wasn’t my very first project, but rather one of the personal challenges I keep setting for myself.

I wanted to:

Sharpen my JavaScript logic skills 🧠

Improve my ability to style and design clean UIs 🎨

Push myself to build projects

It’s part of my journey to keep leveling up as a developer — learning by building and refining.
